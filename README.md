# xladd-util

Simple Excel utilities based on the xladd library. This is a standalone dynamic load library (xll) that can be loaded into Excel and which adds some useful generic functions to Excel.

# Loading

The xll can be loaded into Excel by simply using File/Open to open it, or by registering it as an addin, or by using VBA to load it. The VBA loader method may be useful if you have other addins, and want to control either the load order or the environment.
